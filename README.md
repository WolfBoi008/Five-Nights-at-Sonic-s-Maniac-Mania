# Archipelago Manual for Five Nights at Sonic's: Maniac Mania

## Notes
- You must play from a new save file, but you can edit the save file for things such as character skins. I plan to change this in the future (See #12 for details).
- Shop items are pre-hinted. I want Rings not to appear in the shop, but I believe this currently doesn't work in the latest Manual build.

## Goals
- Complete the Maniac Mania challenge
- Defeat Phantom Ian
- Complete the Encore challenge (unlocked after defeating Phantom Ian)

## Items
- Characters (need all the necessary characters for a challenge)
- Shop Items (Cosmetic but needed for achievements)
- Rings (for the Shop checks)
- Tokens for Achievements (local and plando'd; needed for the Phantom Ian-related goals and planning on removing them once I figure out a band-aid fix)

## Checks
- Challenges
- Achievements
- Jumpscares
- Buying things in the Shop
- Beating Phantom Ian
