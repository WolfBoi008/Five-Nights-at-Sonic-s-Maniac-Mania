# Archipelago Manual for Five Nights at Sonic's: Maniac Mania

## Notes
- You must play from a new game. Otherwise you'll have to edit your save file at some point. I may upload a 100% save file and/or info on each value in the save file in the future.

## Goals
- Complete the Maniac Mania challenge
- Defeat Phantom Ian
- Complete the Encore challenge (unlocked after defeating Phantom Ian)

## Items
- Characters (need all the necessary characters for a challenge)
- Shop Items (Cosmetic but needed for achievements)
- Rings (for the Shop checks)
- Tokens for Achievements (local and plando'd; needed for the Phantom Ian-related goals and planning on removing them once I figure out a band-aid fix)

## Checks
- Challenges
- Achievements
- Jumpscares
- Buying things in the Shop
- Beating Phantom Ian

## Options
- Survival and Post-MM: Enable or disable the Checks that are related to Survival Mode or Post-Maniac Mania.
  - **You must have Maniac Mania as your Goal if you want to disable these.**
- Poster Logic: Alter the logic of F and Mega F to consider the office poster.
