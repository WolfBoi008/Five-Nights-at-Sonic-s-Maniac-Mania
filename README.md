# Archipelago Manual for Five Nights at Sonic's: Maniac Mania

## Notes
- This game is a free to play fangame.
- You must play from a new save file, but you can edit the save file for things such as character skins. I plan to add a guide on this in the future if more people want to play it.
- Shop items are pre-hinted. I want Rings to not appear in the shop, but this currently doesn't work in the latest Stable.

## Goals
- Complete the Maniac Mania challenge
- Defeat Phantom Ian
- Complete the Encore challenge (unlocked after defeating Phantom Ian)

## Items
- Characters (need all the necessary characters for a challenge)
- Shop Items (Cosmetic but needed for achievements)
- Rings (for the Shop checks)
- Tokens for Jumpscares and Achievements (local and plando'd; needed for achievements and the final boss goal, respectively)

## Checks
- Challenges
- Achievements
- Jumpscares
- Buying things in the Shop
